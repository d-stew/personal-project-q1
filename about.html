        <h3>About Speed CandiDating</h3>
        <h4 class="about-page">Speed CandiDating was built using HTML5 and CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery, along with Twitter's Bootstrap.
          Candidate profiles were assembled using information from official candidate websites and sites like <a href="http://www.insidegov.com/">InsideGov</a>, <a href="http://2016election.procon.org/view.source-summary-chart.php">ProCon.org</a>, and <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/default.htm">OnTheIssues</a>.
          Each candidate's policy profile is hard-coded and compared with user responses using JavaScript.
          The site also features Facebook's API to give users the ability to share Speed CandiDating with friends.
